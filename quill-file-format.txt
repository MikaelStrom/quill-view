    2.9  QUILL DOCUMENT FILES  (doc)

     These files hold a QUILL document.

     If the file size is less than 2048, then it is rounded up to
     this size.  If larger than this, then it is rounded up to the
     next multiple of 512 bytes.

     File Header

     The start of the file always contains a standard header that
     identifies the file type, and locates the various areas within
     the file.

                              header).   Acts as a pointer to the
                              start of the paragraph table.

                              (including header).  Acts as a pointer
                              to the Free Space table.

      16       2              Length of the Free Space Table
                              (including header).  Acts as a pointer
                              to the Layout Table.

      18       2              Length of the Layout table.  There may
                              well be additional free space between
                              the end of the Layout table and the
                              end-of-file.  This extra area can
                              contain any random data.


     Text Area

     This area holds the text that makes up the main body of the
     document.

     The first two 'paragraphs' are always the Header and Footer
     text (if any) of the document.

     The text is held in simple ASCII format, but with imbedded
     control characters.  The control characters are as follows:
          Hex       Description

          00        End of Paragraph/Hard Newline.  This resets all
                    highlighting attributes to 'off'.

          09        Tab. Tab positions are determined using the Tab
                    tables (as described later).

     PARAGRAPH TABLE

     This table is used to control attributes that apply to a whole
     paragraph.  Entries 1 and 2 refer to the header/footer
     respectively.  As far as can be told these entries are
     irrelevant.

           4        2              The length of the paragraph.
                                   This length includes the NULL
                                   byte that terminates the
                                   paragraph text.

     FREE SPACE TABLE

     This entry never seems to have anything relevant in it, and is
     always the same size.  This may mean that it is no longer used,
     and is a hangover from an earlier version of Quill.

     LAYOUT TABLE

     This table has a fixed part, and is then followed by a variable
     number of tab entries.  The fixed part seems to vary between
     the QL/OPD and the MSDOS implementations.
